## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or higher recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) (npm is included with Node.js)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) (for cloning the repository)

---

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the project locally.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

   Using npm:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   Or using Yarn:

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

### Running in Development Mode

To start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

or

```bash
yarn dev
```

The development server will start at `http://localhost:3000`. Open this URL in your browser to view the app. The page will automatically reload if you make changes to the code.

### Building for Production

To build the project for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

or

```bash
yarn build
```

This will create an optimized production build in the `.next` folder.

To start the production server:
