Later, I divided my time between maintaining the Croydon site and collaborating on the development of a white-label version, known as LocalGov, for distribution to other councils. This initiative has been a resounding success, with numerous councils adopting the codebase. As the sole front-end development and accessibility specialist within a multi-disciplinary Agile team working in two-week sprints, I have also partnered with the Shaw Trust to meet WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards. In addition, I manage a WordPress site designed to engage digital businesses across the Croydon area.",
