Initially, I helped develop a new PHP-based Drupal 8 website on an Azure DevOps platform—a system that has since been upgraded to Drupal 10. Later, I divided my time between maintaining the Croydon site and collaborating on the development of a white-label version, known as LocalGov, for distribution to other councils. This initiative has been a resounding success, with numerous councils adopting the codebase. As the sole front-end development and accessibility specialist within a multi-disciplinary Agile team working in two-week sprints, I have also partnered with the Shaw Trust to meet WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards. In addition, I manage a WordPress site designed to engage digital businesses across the Croydon area.",

I then moved onto various other projects such as iPhone releases, the 4G product release, an in-store fast track upgrade system and two SMB customer portals. In early 2014 the business shop was over-hauled with a series of new interfaces and a re-designed product builder and I handled the front end development work on the project. The business shop runs on the cloud based ‘SalesForce’ platform and I worked with both in-house and off shore development teams. I used skills in ‘Apex’ Code, hand coded HTML5, CSS3, SASS, Native JavaScript, JQuery, JSON, XML, Photoshop, SVN &amp; Jira.",
