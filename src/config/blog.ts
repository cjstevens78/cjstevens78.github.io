Visual indicators of errors should not rely solely on color â€“ use icons, text, and other visual cues to ensure the message is clear to all users, including those with color blindness. Additionally, error messages should appear in real-time when possible, rather than waiting for form submission, giving users immediate feedback about their input."

Server-side validation is essential, and the responses need to be equally accessible. Success messages should be announced to screen reader users, potentially using ARIA live regions. Required fields should be clearly indicated both visually and programmatically using the 'required' attribute and appropriate visual indicators. The goal is to create a form that guides users through the completion process while accommodating different abilities and interaction methods."

          "text": "Finally, consider the overall form layout and design. Long forms should be broken into manageable sections using `<fieldset>` and `<legend>` to group related fields. The tab order should be logical and follow the visual layout of the form. Provide clear instructions at the beginning of the form about required fields, time limits (if any), and what information users need to have ready. Remember that some users may need more time to complete forms, so avoid unnecessary time limits or provide clear ways to extend them. By following these practices and regularly testing with various assistive technologies, you can create forms that are truly accessible to all users."

Instead of div-soup, use semantic elements like `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, and `<aside>`.

When state changes affect content visibility or functionality, make sure to update relevant ARIA attributes accordingly. Use `aria-live` regions to announce dynamic content changes, `aria-expanded` for collapsible sections, and `aria-selected` for tabbed interfaces.
